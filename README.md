# About
This is a basic Full-Stack Rails App that allows users to sign in or sign up and add books to a bookshelf (home page) in which they can review and rate them. Other users can also sign up and view the bookshelf, reviews, and ratings or add a book, review, and rating.

# Usage 
This is still in progress, but all current features work. There is no data saved to the database but they can all be created in the rails console or Rails backend using http requests (just check the schema)
